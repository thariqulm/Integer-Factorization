# Integer-Factorization
To factorize any integer with any number of digits.
Since factorization of very large integers are 
still hard to compute this script ensures that once
You've factored a number the factors are stored
in the FactorDB database so that it can be accessed
whenever required. This eliminates the need for
computing the factors for the same integer again
and again. No algorithm is still capable of factoring
very large integers (like large semiprimes) within
polynomial time.
